# Ecommerce Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

This project is a deep-dive exploration of 10,000 ecommerce records using *Python* and *Pandas* given by my course centre. I focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights through advanced filtering and feature extraction techniques.

##  What I Accomplished
I solved a series of data challenges ranging from basic statistics to complex data manipulation:

* *Feature Extraction :* I used lambda functions to parse strings and extract specific data, such as identifying the email domain host from full email addresses.
* *Temporal Analysis:* I engineered a way to filter the CC Exp Date column to find all users whose credit cards expire specifically in *2025*.
* *Advanced Filtering:* I performed multi-conditional queries, such as finding users who spent over *$95* and used *American Express* as their provider.
* *Behavioral Insights:* I analyzed the distribution of purchases to find that *PM* transactions (5,068) slightly outweigh *AM* transactions (4,932).

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
* *Pandas:* For data wrangling, cleaning, and aggregation.
* *Jupyter Notebook:* To document the step-by-step analytical process.
* *Python:* Specifically using .apply(), .count(), and complex boolean indexing.

## 📊 Quick Results from the Notebook
* *Average Purchase Price:* $50.35
* *Highest Price Paid:* $99.99
* *Most Common Job:* Interior and spatial designer
* *Most Common Language:* English (en)
